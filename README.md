# Ergast

Ergast is an experimental Motor Racing Developer API. It provides historial and current data about motor racing including the popular sport Formuls 1.
This project resamples a React web app where the standings and races of the formula 1 are fetched from the Spring backend which is fetches data from the Ergast API. Besides fetching the data, it is possible to apply 3 different score systems (Season's scoring system, 1991-2002 and 2003-2009) on the standings, seeing different scores.
